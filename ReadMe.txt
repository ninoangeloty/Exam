Some Notes:

(1) Please use the url '\Exam' to view the exam answer as I have used the default MVC template for this solution.

(2) I have created a Database Project 'FPExam.Database' so that you can publish the database without me having to supply the MDF file of SQL Server. Just make sure to change the connection string from the web.config if you are running the application.

(3) The package is setup to use NuGet package restore so I have not included the binaries/assemblies for some of the NuGet tools that I used.
